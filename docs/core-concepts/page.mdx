# Core Concepts

- `BeanAdapter` is the public facade for terminal interactions.
- Prompt APIs return `null` when cancelled and values otherwise.
- Rendering APIs are split by concern: messages, notes/boxes, table/tree/json/diff, and style helpers.
- Runtime wiring is centralized in infrastructure composition to keep object creation explicit.
